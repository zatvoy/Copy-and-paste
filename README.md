# Copy-and-paste
🧠 Smart Multi Stack Copy
Smart Multi Stack Copy is a lightweight and efficient clipboard tool for Windows that solves a major limitation in the default copy-paste functionality.

🔍 Problem
On Windows, the default clipboard behavior only allows one item to be copied at a time. There’s no built-in shortcut or feature that allows users to:

Copy multiple selections (texts) from different sources using Ctrl+C

Then paste them all at once, in the same order, using a single Ctrl+V keystroke

This limitation slows down tasks that require gathering information from multiple places quickly, such as compiling research, coding references, or documentation notes.

✅ Solution: This Tool
Smart Multi Stack Copy enhances the clipboard experience by allowing:

📋 Multiple Ctrl+C operations in a session

📥 Automatically collecting all copied texts into a sequential stack

📤 Pasting the entire stacked content in order using a single Ctrl+V

🧹 Stack resets after pasting, readying it for the next batch

🔄 Toggle control to start or stop the clipboard listener

🔒 Lightweight and safe, does not modify system settings

🚀 How It Works
Start the Tool – Launch the application and click "Turn ON" to activate.

Copy Normally – Use Ctrl+C to copy any number of texts from various places (web pages, documents, code, etc.)

Paste Smartly – Press Ctrl+V once, and all copied texts will be pasted in the exact sequence you copied them.

Auto Reset – After pasting, the clipboard stack clears for the next use.
